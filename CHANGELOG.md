# Changelog

## 0.54.1 - 2026-08-25

Closes a reachable infinite loop in the coaching backend's HTTP path.

### Fixed

- **`golang.org/x/text` bumped past GO-2026-5970.** govulncheck reported
  it as reachable, not merely present: v0.38.0 loops forever on invalid
  input, and the trace ran from `llm.OpenAICompatBackend.Generate`
  through `http.Client.Do` into `norm.Form`. That is the coaching
  backend's outbound path, so the triggering input is a provider
  response — a hang caused by something tokenops does not control.

  v0.41.0 clears it. `govulncheck` now reports no vulnerabilities.

### Added

- **Dependabot config** (`gomod`, `github-actions`, `npm`), grouped by
  family. The auto-merge workflow had been idling since it was added —
  it acts on Dependabot PRs and nothing was configured to open any — so
  Go modules were never watched, and this one drifted far enough to
  carry a reachable CVE unnoticed.

## 0.54.0 - 2026-08-25

Request counts stop including tokenops talking to itself.

### Changed

- **The MCP server's own activity pings no longer count as traffic you
  made.** `mcp-session` events are the MCP server recording that it was
  called; they carry no tokens and no cost, but they were landing in the
  request total that `tokenops spend`, `burn_rate`, `top_consumers` and
  `forecast` report. An operator reading "42 requests" was reading some
  number of their own calls plus some number of tokenops talking to
  itself, with no way to tell the two apart. They are now excluded by
  default, alongside `demo` — the scorecard already drew the line here.

  Request counts on installs that use the MCP server will drop. Nothing
  about spend or tokens changes: the pings never carried either.

- **`--include-demo` splits into per-source opt-in.** It used to clear
  the entire exclude list, so asking to see synthetic seeds folded in
  every other excluded source too. `--include-source` (CLI, repeatable
  and comma-separated) and `include_sources` (MCP) re-admit sources by
  name:

  ```bash
  tokenops spend --include-source=demo                # seeds only
  tokenops spend --include-source=demo,mcp-session    # both
  ```

  `--include-demo` and `include_demo: true` still work, as aliases for
  `demo` alone. A named source that is not excluded by default prints a
  note rather than failing, so the flag never silently does nothing.

## 0.53.0 - 2026-08-25

Answers "does quality degrade as context grows" from the operator's own
transcripts rather than from assumption.

### Added

- **`tokenops dx` reports quality against context size.** Instructions are
  banded by how full the window was when they ran, and each band carries
  the rejection rate, the repeated-call rate, and median turns.

- **Repeated tool calls** — the agent re-issuing a call it already made
  with identical arguments. This is the signal that shows the effect: on
  the maintainer's Claude Code corpus it runs 1.7% below 600k of context
  and 2.6% above, a 53% increase over roughly 80,000 calls.

  It is drift rather than error, which is why rejection misses it — an
  operator rarely tells the agent off for redoing something, they watch it
  happen and form an impression.

  Two controls make the number mean anything: the lookback is bounded to
  fifty calls, so session length cannot inflate it, and it is scoped per
  session, because an agent cannot repeat itself across a boundary it has
  no memory of.

- **Rejection rate per band**, the operator's own quality verdict. Worth
  reporting even where it shows nothing: on this corpus it is flat, and
  rework and tool errors actively fall with context — both confounded by
  session position, since a low-context instruction is usually an early
  one while the agent is still orienting.

## 0.52.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **The Stop nudge reports context against the model's window.** Dollars
  are a counterfactual on a flat-rate plan; context is not — it fills up,
  forces a compaction, and until then every turn re-reads the whole of
  it.

      Context: 873k of 1.0M (87%) — worth compacting: every turn now
      re-reads this whole context.

  Window sizes come from Anthropic's pricing page (Claude 4.6 and later
  carry the full 1M window) and are confirmed by a real 999,947-token
  turn. An `[1m]` suffix outranks the family default. An unrecognised
  model reports its context size with no percentage — a share against a
  guessed denominator looks authoritative and is not.

  The advice escalates: silent below 75%, a note at 75%, and at 90% the
  fact that an automatic compaction is imminent and will choose what to
  drop.

## 0.51.1 - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **The Stop nudge read as a bill.** It told an operator paying $200 a
  month for Claude Max that they were "over your $50 session budget".
  Three things were wrong at once: they never chose $50 (it is the
  shipping default, and the possessive implied an agreement never made),
  only the quietest tier said "API-equivalent" so the louder the warning
  got the more it looked like real money, and nothing said the figure is
  not a charge at all.

  On a subscription it is a counterfactual — what the session would have
  cost at list price — which is the only way to watch context drift
  compound when the actual bill is flat either way. The wording now says
  so at every tier, calls the default a default, and reserves "your
  budget" for one the operator actually set.

## 0.51.0 - 2026-08-24

The reply coach reads opencode, completing coaching coverage across every
client that keeps a local record.

### Added

- **`tokenops coach replies` reads opencode.** Same store as the prompt
  reader, opposite role filter. 14,139 replies on the maintainer's
  machine were outside the report.

  Reasoning parts are excluded: they are the model thinking, not the
  prose the operator read, and this coach measures output density as
  experienced.

- **`--source` on `coach replies`**, mirroring `coach prompts`.

## 0.50.0 - 2026-08-24

The prompt coach reads opencode.

### Added

- **`tokenops coach prompts` reads opencode.** It keeps history in SQLite
  rather than JSONL, so it is a store to open rather than a root to walk:
  prompt text lives on a part row joined to its message. 3,960 operator
  prompts on the maintainer's machine were previously invisible to the
  coach.

  Continuation prompts opencode injects for itself are marked `synthetic`
  and dropped — coaching someone on words they never wrote would be worse
  than not coaching them at all.

- **`--source` on `coach prompts`**: `auto` (default) | `claude-code` |
  `codex` | `opencode`, so a single client can be inspected on its own.

## 0.49.0 - 2026-08-24

Agent DX now reads opencode, and reports per upstream provider.

### Added

- **`tokenops dx --source opencode`.** The richest client store and the
  only multi-provider one: token counts and a completion time on every
  assistant row, tool calls joined by message_id, and compactions as an
  explicit part type rather than something to be recognised.

- **Per-provider breakdown.** Only a multi-provider client records which
  upstream served a turn, so this is the only way to ask whether one
  provider is a worse experience than another. Providers under twenty
  prompts are not reported separately — their percentages swing on single
  events.

### Fixed

- **Tool names were matched case-sensitively.** Claude Code writes "Task"
  and "Edit"; opencode writes "task" and "edit". The lookup silently
  reported zero delegation and zero rework for every client but one.

- **An unmeasured rate rendered as 0.0%**, which reads as "the agent never
  redid its work" when the truth is that no edits were seen. It reports
  n/a now — the same distinction between a missing measurement and a
  measured zero that this work keeps turning up.

## 0.48.0 - 2026-08-24

Agent DX now reads every client that keeps a local record, and the
optimizer has an explicit three-way mode instead of two states buried in
a daemon-wide flag.

### Added

- **`optimizer.mode`: `automatic` | `in_request` | `off`.** Automatic
  rewrites matching requests in flight; in_request refers the decision to
  you through the MCP surface and forwards the request untouched; off
  records what the rules would have done and changes nothing. Unset means
  off — opting into an intervention has to be an act, not a default, and
  a misspelling fails validation rather than silently reading as off.

  Routing no longer requires the daemon-wide `active` flag, which only
  gated it because there was nowhere else to express intent.

- **`tokenops dx --source codex`.** Codex marks what these metrics need
  explicitly, where Claude Code leaves it inferred: `user_message` is
  unambiguously the operator's instruction and `turn_aborted` is
  unambiguously an interrupt.

- **`tokenops dx --source cursor`.** Reads Cursor's `cursorDiskKV` store
  read-only. A store that exists but cannot be understood returns a
  schema error rather than an empty report — an unreadable store must not
  render as an idle operator.

- **`--source auto`** (the default) reads every client present. A pinned
  `--root` narrows it to one tree rather than being ignored while the
  readers scan the real home directory.

### Fixed

- **Window-pressure routing ignored the vendor's own reading.** Codex
  publishes `rate_limits` per turn and Copilot and Cursor publish quota
  snapshots; the probe counted messages instead, and that heuristic only
  works for Claude Code — so pressure rules were inert for every other
  provider. The resolver moved from the MCP adapter into the domain and
  the probe now prefers ground truth.

## 0.47.0 - 2026-08-23

Completes the agent-experience metrics and puts them to work: everything
is graded, one change is named, and the agent can read them itself.

### Added

- **Four more DX metrics.** Wall-clock per instruction (median + p90),
  tokens per instruction, tool calls per instruction, and a first-try
  rate — the share of instructions completed with no rework, no
  interrupt, and no delegation. Wall-clock matters separately from turns:
  turns measure effort, this measures waiting, and they diverge.

- **Grades on every DX metric.** Thresholds are set where a difference
  changes what an operator would do, not at a statistical quantile. The
  overall grade is the WORST of the measured dimensions rather than the
  average — an experience is only as good as its sharpest friction.
  Unmeasured metrics stay ungraded: never a zero, never an F.

- **One named recommendation**, ordered by leverage rather than severity.
  Rework and interrupts are what a clearer instruction fixes today; turn
  count is usually their symptom.

- **`tokenops_agent_dx`.** Hands the graded metrics and the
  recommendation to the agent, so it can act on the session it is in
  rather than the operator reading a report afterwards.

## 0.46.0 - 2026-08-23

TEU stopped reporting "not measured" while real uplift was happening, and
the product gained a second dimension: what sessions are like to work
with, not just what they cost.

### Added

- **`tokenops dx`.** Six agent-experience metrics derived from
  transcripts the client already writes — turns per instruction (median
  and p90), context growth per turn, rework rate, interrupt rate,
  escalation rate, compactions per session. Work is grouped by operator
  instruction, which is turns-per-task without asking anyone to mark
  tasks by hand.

  Time-to-first-token is deliberately absent: a transcript records when a
  turn finished, never when it started streaming, so no passive reader
  can populate it honestly. It stays proxy-only.

- **TEU counts client-side interventions.** The read guard prevents
  redundant re-reads inside the client, where the proxy cannot see them,
  and had reclaimed ~387,000 tokens with nothing recording it. A daemon
  poller now publishes each blocked read as an `OptimizationEvent` under a
  new `read_dedup` kind, so a client that never proxies can score on TEU
  at all. Only actual blocks count — an observe-mode `would_block` saved
  nothing.

### Fixed

- **The scorecard reported a failure as an absence.** `Build` discarded
  `Compute`'s error, so an unreadable store rendered every KPI as
  "N/A (not measured)" — indistinguishable from a metric nobody measured.
  Widening `--since-days` past what the reader loads inside its deadline
  therefore produced *fewer* numbers with no explanation, intermittently.
  The reason now travels on the scorecard and is rendered.

## 0.45.0 - 2026-08-23

The optimisation half of the product accounted in dollars. On a flat-rate
subscription dollars are always `$0.00`, so every number was either zero
or a counterfactual and no test failed. This release makes tokens and the
rate-limit window first-class, stops two KPIs grading data that was never
measured, and turns `init` into the single command that wires the machine.

Minor rather than patch: `init` now registers MCP servers and installs
hooks by default (`--no-wire` restores the old behaviour), the read guard
promotes itself to active once its ledger justifies it, and scorecard
JSON drops unmeasured KPI blocks instead of emitting them.

### Added

- **Rate-limit window routing.** `optimizer.routing_rules[].when_window_pct_above`
  scopes a rule to periods when the plan window is at least that full. On
  a subscription the window is what runs out, not money, so a rule can now
  keep you on your best model while there is headroom and conserve it only
  when there is not. A rule stays idle when the window cannot be measured
  or its reading is over ten minutes old — acting on an unmeasured
  shortage is worse than not acting.

- **Task-aware routing.** `when_class: mechanical | reasoning` scopes a
  rule to the kind of work a turn is, classified from instruction length,
  tool-call density, and whether the operator just rejected the previous
  answer. The classifier abstains rather than guesses: anything unclear
  keeps the model the client asked for.

- **Preferred model as a ceiling.** `preferred_models` per provider. Routes
  to cheaper models still apply automatically; a route to something
  pricier is refused, recorded, and surfaced through
  `tokenops_routing_proposals` / `tokenops_routing_decide` for an answer.
  Decisions apply from the next matching request without a restart.

- **Token budgets.** `basis: tokens` with `limit_tokens`. Both previous
  bases were dollar quantities and validation required a positive
  `limit_usd`, so a flat-rate operator could only budget against imaginary
  money.

- **Token forecasts.** The dashboard API, `tokenops_forecast`, and
  `tokenops spend --forecast` now project token volume alongside cost.
  `forecast.TotalTokens` had existed since the forecaster was written with
  no callers.

- **`init` wires the machine.** Registers the MCP server with every host
  found (Claude Code, Claude Desktop), installs the hooks, and reports what
  still needs a human. Re-running repairs drift. Everything is idempotent,
  backed up, and atomic; an unparseable host config is refused rather than
  clobbered.

- **Verified rate cards for Claude Opus 5 and Mythos 5**, checked against
  the vendor pricing page and cross-checked against a LiteLLM snapshot.
  Marked `verified: true` so a stale upstream cannot regress them.

- **Reply coach recommendations.** `tokenops coach replies` proposes an
  output-density target drawn from the operator's own leanest substantial
  session, with the evidence attached. It declines when a corpus is
  already within 25% of its own best.

### Fixed

- **The 5-hour window meter read `0 / 200` under any load.**
  `countsAsMessage` excluded `assistant_turn` events on sound reasoning —
  one prompt fans out into many turns — but that reader is ~99.8% of
  ingested events, so nothing was left to count. The reader now marks the
  first assistant turn after each operator prompt, identified by content
  shape (most `type:"user"` rows are tool-result echoes). On real
  transcripts a window holding 2,990 turns resolves to 69 prompts.

- **Token savings were gated on a dollar comparison.** The router returned
  `(0, 0)` whenever a route's price delta was not positive, discarding the
  token measurement with it — and TEU sums that field, so a dollar test
  starved the headline token metric.

- **Plan-covered traffic was priced at list rates** in the router and
  replay, which build synthetic events whose zero-value `CostSource`
  deserialises as metered.

- **Pricing gaps in plan-covered traffic were invisible.** The error from
  `spend.Compute` was discarded, so an unpriced model contributed nothing
  to the API-equivalent figure and left no trace. On a real store this hid
  16,429 requests — 97% of a week — behind a figure computed from the rest.

- **Two KPIs graded data that was never measured.** TEU fell back to a 15%
  constant and printed `[B]`; FVT medianed a `Latency` field no passive
  reader populated, and zero seconds grades `[A]`. Both now report N/A when
  unmeasured — and FVT is now genuinely measured, reconstructed from
  transcript timestamps with guards for idle gaps and clock skew.

- **The 24h burn line was flat under any load.** The sparkline keyed on
  `CostUSD`, zero for every plan-covered row.

- **`replay` reported 0% saved for plan-covered sessions.** Adds
  `SavingsRatioTokens` from fields the result already carried.

- **A `rules.root` pointing at a deleted directory failed silently.** Now a
  `rules_root_missing` blocker with a remediation line.

- **Retention pruned rows but never shrank the file.** Opt-in
  `retention.reclaim` runs a VACUUM after a pass that deleted rows.

- **`daemon status` did not name the daemon's log.** The obvious-looking
  `~/.tokenops/daemon.log` is written only by the MCP spawn path; a
  supervised daemon logs wherever its unit redirects stdout.

- **The CLI test suite wrote to the developer's real Claude config.**
  `TestMain` now sandboxes `$HOME` for the whole package.

### Changed

- **The read guard activates when its own ledger justifies it.** It shipped
  in observe mode and stayed there, logging redundant re-reads without
  preventing any. `init` now promotes it to active past a 50k-token bar and
  states the measured reason.

## 0.44.0 - 2026-08-18

Closing the 27-day outage class that v0.43.0 made *visible*: supervise
ingestion so it survives reboot, stop leaking the dashboard token, and
stop telling agents to run a command that does not exist.

Minor rather than patch: `tokenops_dashboard` hint and
`DaemonPresenceNextAction` strings changed (asserted verbatim in tests
and may be parsed downstream), and Gemini cache-read rates changed.

### Added

- **`tokenops daemon install / uninstall / status`.** Writes a launchd
  LaunchAgent (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux) with the real binary
  path and `$HOME`, then loads it. The `deploy/launchd` plist used to
  contain `__TOKENOPS_BIN__` placeholders; copying it as-is exec'd a
  binary that did not exist. `--no-load` writes only; `--dry-run` prints
  the unit. `tokenops init` points here next.

- **Opt-in event-store retention.** `retention.keep` maps event types to
  windows (`30d`, `720h`, …). Empty (the default) deletes nothing. When
  set, `tokenops start` runs the pruner that previously existed only as
  a tested-but-unwired package. Audit log is never pruned.

### Fixed

- **`~/.tokenops/daemon.url` is `0600`.** It carries `dashboard_token`.
  The dedicated token file was already `0600`; the hint file was `0644`,
  so any local account could read dashboard auth.

- **Agents are told to run `tokenops start`, not `tokenops up`.**
  `tokenops_dashboard`, the dashboard HTML, and poller comments still
  named a command that does not exist. Status already said `start`.

- **archlint lists every `internal/contexts/*` package.** The AGENTS.md
  contract was already broken on main (~28 of ~51 packages). Stale
  `storageExempt` entries that did not import sqlite are gone;
  `TestDomainPackagesComplete` and `TestStorageExemptImportsSQLite` keep
  it from drifting.

### Changed

- **Gemini 2.5 catalog rows vendor-verified and pinned.** Google's
  pricing page (and Vertex) list cache-read at 10% of input: Pro
  `$1.25/$10/$0.125`, Flash `$0.30/$2.50/$0.03`, Flash-Lite
  `$0.10/$0.40/$0.01`. The catalog had the older `$0.31` / `$0.075`
  explicit-cache figures. Gemini 1.5 is no longer on the vendor page
  and stays unpinned for back-pricing. Sources:
  https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing

- Docs/install path: published quickstart, SECURITY supported versions,
  CONTRIBUTING disclosure address, README release platforms, and Pages
  Node 24 now match `main` (cask on `klarlabs-studio/tap`, module
  `go.klarlabs.de/tokenops`, current minor).

## 0.43.0 - 2026-08-03

Making a dead ingestion pipeline visible. Every change here comes from a
post-mortem of a 27-day outage in which TokenOps ingested nothing while every
surface answered successfully.

### Fixed

- **The staleness warning states how long a source has actually been silent.**
  It could only ask "were there events in the last 48h?", so the text read
  identically on the second day of an outage and the twenty-seventh.
  `StaleSource.SilentFor` now comes from a new `Store.LastEventBySource`, and
  `Severity()` escalates — warning, degraded at 7 days, critical at 14.

  ```
  before  ingestion stale: claude-code-jsonl has 0 events in the last 48h
  after   ingestion stale [critical]: anthropic-cookie has produced no events
          for 52 days (checked a 48h window)
  ```

- **The remedy named the wrong program.** It said to "reconnect the MCP server
  or restart the daemon", conflating two things: `tokenops serve` is the MCP
  server and ingests nothing, `tokenops start` runs the pollers. During the
  outage eleven `serve` processes were running and `start` was not, so the
  advice pointed at the healthy half. Both the warning and
  `StaleIngestionNextAction` now say `tokenops start` explicitly.

### Added

- **Spend answers say when they cannot be trusted.** `tokenops_spend_summary`
  and `tokenops_burn_rate` carry a `measurement` block when an enabled source
  has stopped ingesting: `trusted: false`, the severity of the worst gap, and a
  note that the figure is a lower bound rather than a measurement of zero. A
  total of zero has two causes — nothing spent, or nothing measured — and they
  were formatted identically. Healthy ingestion adds no field.

- **`tokenops_status` reports when no ingestion daemon is reachable.** `serve`
  and `start` share nothing but `events.db`, so with the daemon absent serve
  answered every query against a store that had stopped being written. This
  fires immediately rather than after the stale window, and is unambiguous in a
  way a quiet source is not. A warning, not a blocker: serve genuinely answers
  queries, so it degrades `ready` the same way stale ingestion does.

- **`deploy/launchd/de.klarlabs.tokenops.plist`** supervises the ingestion
  daemon with `KeepAlive` and `RunAtLoad`. Nothing supervised `start`, so a
  reboot silently ended observability while the client kept respawning `serve`.

### Note

`measurement` is additive, but the staleness warning and next-action strings
changed. They are asserted verbatim in the MCP and CLI status tests and may be
parsed downstream — hence a minor rather than a patch.

## 0.42.x - 2026-07-08 → 2026-07-26

Not previously recorded here. Release plumbing and MCP schema work: publish a
Homebrew cask instead of a formula (#158, #159, #160), advertise output schemas
for the data tools (#157), bump `go.klarlabs.de/mcp` to v1.22.0 (#156), and CI
budget/reliability fixes (#154, #155).


## 0.41.0 - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Verified catalog-row pinning (`verified: true`).** The runtime prices events
  with the effective-dated engine, where a fetched snapshot overrides the baseline
  for current events — so an upstream source that goes stale on a model silently
  regresses a rate you verified (LiteLLM still priced the deprecated `deepseek-chat`
  alias at `$0.28` after the catalog was corrected to `$0.14`). A row marked
  `verified: true` is now authoritative: its snapshot value is stripped before
  layering (`spend.DefaultPinnedKeys` / `pricing.SnapshotsToDatedTables`), so the
  cost engine keeps the baseline. Unpinned rows still auto-adopt and new models
  still surface. The non-Anthropic vendor-verified rows are pinned — the exact rows
  the Anthropic-family consistency guard cannot cover.
- **`pricing diff` / `pricing show` flag pinned rows.** Both render the raw snapshot
  for provenance, so a pinned row shows the source value and `diff` lists it as
  drift; they now mark those rows `[pinned]` with a legend clarifying the cost
  engine prices at the baseline — so a stale source is never "corrected" into the
  catalog.

### Changed

- **Pricing research (ADR 0002) broadened from Anthropic-only to all providers.**
  Phase 1 hard-scoped snapshots to Anthropic; the hand-maintained non-Anthropic
  baseline had since drifted (Mistral rows stale, DeepSeek off) while nothing
  sourced it. Snapshots now cover **every provider the catalog prices** (OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Mistral, Gemini, Cohere, Groq, DeepSeek, xAI, Perplexity, Cerebras).
  - **Snapshot re-keying.** `Snapshot.Rates` is now keyed `"<provider>/<model>"`
    (e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`, `openai/gpt-4o`) instead of bare model,
    matching the multi-provider engine table (`spend.Key{Provider, Model}`). The
    embedded baseline and `Snapshot.Table()` span all providers; a fetched rate
    overrides the correct vendor's baseline row via `MergeOverrides`.
  - **All-provider LiteLLM adapter.** The source maps every `litellm_provider`
    to a tokenops provider (e.g. `vertex_ai`/`gemini`→`gemini`,
    `text-completion-openai`→`openai`), skipping providers the catalog can't
    price (fireworks/together/openrouter multiplexers) so the key-space stays
    aligned with the baseline and the diff stays meaningful.
  - **Guard scoped to Anthropic family.** The ratio heuristics (cache-read ≈10%
    of input, output ≈5× input) run **only on `anthropic/*` rows** — other
    providers price on different curves and would false-flag. All rows still get
    a conservative generic sanity check (cache-read must not exceed input).
  - `refresh`'s diff now surfaces real non-Anthropic drift; `show`/`diff` group
    by provider (keys sort `"<provider>/<model>"`).
- **Corrected Mistral, DeepSeek, o1, and grok-3 catalog rates.** With the source
  now surfacing non-Anthropic drift, each drifted row was cross-checked against the
  vendor's pricing page (never single-sourced). Mistral tracks the current
  `-latest` generation — Large 3 `$0.50/$1.50`, Medium 3.5 `$1.50/$7.50`, Small 4
  `$0.15/$0.60`; `deepseek-chat`/`deepseek-reasoner` → `deepseek-v4-flash`
  `$0.14/$0.28` (cache `$0.0028`), the models those deprecated aliases now resolve
  to (retired 2026-07-24); `o1` gains cache-read `$7.50` and `grok-3` cache-read
  `$0.75`. `codestral`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, and `gemini-1.5-flash` were confirmed as
  false drift and left unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Current-SKU collision in the LiteLLM adapter.** When several dated SKUs
  collapsed onto one catalog key (e.g. `mistral-large*`), the adapter kept the
  lexically-first id — the *oldest* archived snapshot (`mistral-large-2402`
  `$4/$12`) — manufacturing false drift. It now picks the newest dated SKU, with
  `-latest` as a fallback (LiteLLM's `-latest` aliases are sometimes stale, e.g.
  `codestral-latest`).
- **OpenAI `MMDD` misorder and distinct-SKU bleed.** `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` (Nov)
  out-ranked `-0125` (Jan) because 4-digit suffixes were compared numerically; a
  4-digit suffix is now treated as a date only when it is a plausible `YYMM`. And a
  broad catalog key no longer absorbs a distinct SKU tier — `grok-3` stopped
  swallowing `grok-3-fast` (`$5/$25`) and `grok-3-mini`.

## 0.40.0 - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **`claude-sonnet-5` in the baseline catalog (`$2/$10/$0.20`).** It was missing —
  the baseline had `claude-sonnet-4-6` ($3/$15/$0.30) but not Sonnet 5, so on the
  offline baseline a Sonnet-5 event wouldn't price. Rate confirmed against **both
  LiteLLM and OpenRouter** ($2 input / $10 output / $0.20 cache-read — Anthropic cut
  Sonnet pricing at 5, like Opus at 4.5). (Events already priced correctly via an
  adopted LiteLLM snapshot; this completes the offline/historical baseline.)

## 0.39.0 - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Reverted the incorrect Opus "correction" from v0.38.0.** v0.38.0 changed Opus
  4.x rates to `$15/$75/$1.50` on the mistaken assumption they follow old-Opus
  pricing. They don't: Anthropic **cut Opus pricing at 4.5** — Opus 4 / 4.1 are
  `$15/$75/$1.50`, but **Opus 4.5–4.8 are `$5/$25/$0.50`** (the value the catalog
  originally had). Confirmed against the LiteLLM feed via `tokenops pricing
  refresh`. Reverted claude-opus-4-{6,7,8} to `$5/$25/$0.50` and restored the
  original tests. The consistency guard couldn't catch this (both `$5` and `$15`
  are internally consistent — cache = 10% of input, output = 5×); only the sourced
  feed could — which is exactly the case ADR 0002's researched pricing is built
  for. It caught a confidently-wrong human edit.

## 0.38.0 - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Corrected Opus 4.x rates in the pricing catalog (were ⅓ too low).**
  `pricing.yaml` priced claude-opus-4-{8,7,6} at `$5/$25/$0.50` per M — exactly ⅓
  of standard Opus 4.x pricing (`$15/$75/$1.50`). Cache-read `$0.50` was
  internally consistent with the wrong `$5` input, so nothing flagged it, and
  every Opus API-equivalent cost (spend summaries, the coach-hook budget) was
  understated **3×**. Fixed to `$15/$75/$1.50`; verified the rest of the Anthropic
  block is internally consistent (cache = 10% of input, output = 5×) — Opus was
  the only miscalibration. This is exactly the silent drift ADR 0002 (below) is
  built to prevent.

### Added

- **Effective-dated cost computation (Phase 2 of
  [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-pricing-research-snapshots.md)).** The cost engine is
  now time-aware: each event is priced at the rate card that was **in effect at
  the event's own timestamp**, instead of one flat table. The engine holds a
  series of effective-dated tables (one per pricing snapshot, keyed by
  `fetched_at`) and selects the table with the greatest `EffectiveFrom ≤` the
  event time; events predating every snapshot — or before the first refresh —
  price on the embedded **baseline**, so costing never fails for lack of a dated
  table. Each dated table layers a snapshot's Anthropic rates onto the full
  catalog, so it stays a complete, authoritative rate card (non-Anthropic
  providers keep pricing; a missing model is a miss, not a fall-through).
  Negotiated-rate overrides (`pricing.path`) apply across every period. The
  effective-dated engine is constructed at the composition root (`internal/
  bootstrap`) and in the CLI `spend` / `replay` paths, and takes effect on the
  live proxy ingest path (priced from `Envelope.Timestamp`) and the analytics
  historical recompute of zero-cost events. Construction is fail-soft — any load
  error degrades to the flat baseline engine, so costing never breaks. With no
  refreshes yet, behavior is byte-for-byte identical to before. New API:
  `spend.NewDatedEngine` / `Engine.ComputeAt`, `pricing.EffectiveEngine` /
  `SnapshotsToDatedTables`. See
  [docs/pricing-research.md](docs/pricing-research.md).
- **`tokenops pricing` — researched, sourced, timestamped pricing snapshots
  (Phase 1 of [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-pricing-research-snapshots.md)).** Model
  rates stop being a single hand-maintained table and become a series of
  provenance-carrying snapshots fetched from a **pluggable source** (default:
  **LiteLLM** `model_prices_and_context_window.json` — vendor list prices, no
  key). New subcommands:
  - `pricing refresh [--source litellm] [--url] [--dir] [--dry-run]` — fetch →
    run the **consistency guard** (warn) → **diff** against the latest snapshot
    (or baseline) → write a timestamped snapshot. Drift is now **loud**: the
    historical Opus ⅓ error would have shouted
    `claude-opus-4-8 cache_read 0.5 → 1.5 (+200%)` instead of hiding. On a fetch
    error, refresh prints a clear message and exits non-zero **without writing**.
  - `pricing show [--snapshot latest|baseline|<ts>] [--json]` — list a
    snapshot's rates.
  - `pricing diff [--from] [--to]` — diff two snapshots (default
    `baseline → latest`).
  - `pricing lint [--snapshot]` — run the consistency guard (cache-read ≈10% of
    input, output ≈5× input, per family — the exact check that caught Opus) and
    exit non-zero on anomalies, for CI.

  Snapshots are append-only atomic JSON under
  `~/.tokenops/pricing/snapshots/<RFC3339>.json`; the embedded `pricing.yaml`
  remains the always-present offline **baseline**. Fetching uses an injectable
  HTTP client (tests run against `httptest`, never the live network). **No
  hot-path change:** the cost engine still uses the built-in table — snapshots
  are written and inspectable but not yet consulted. Effective-dating is Phase 2.
  See [docs/pricing-research.md](docs/pricing-research.md).

## 0.37.0 - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Stale-ingestion health warning in `tokenops status` (CLI + `tokenops_status`
  MCP tool).** `status` now flags **runtime** ingestion staleness, not just
  config blockers: when an **enabled** vendor-usage source has emitted **0**
  events in the last **48h**, status emits a soft `warnings` entry
  (`"ingestion stale: <source> has 0 events in the last 48h — if you've been
  using it, reconnect/restart the poller …"`), appends a remediation
  `next_action`, and downgrades a `ready` state to `degraded` (still
  `ready:true`). Stale sources are **never** added to `blockers` — those stay
  config-level hard gates. This closes a real incident where tokenops silently
  served `$0`/stale spend because a `claude_code_jsonl` poller had ingested
  nothing for ~a week while `status` reported healthy. The check is
  store-interface-based and nil-safe (a missing store yields no warnings, never
  a panic), and a `0` count can also legitimately mean the vendor simply hasn't
  been used recently. The enabled-source↔SourceTag mapping is now shared
  (`config.VendorUsageSources`) so `tokenops vendor-usage status` and the health
  check can't drift.

## 0.36.0 - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- **Coach-hook Phase 1.1 (ADR 0001): cumulative session-budget alerts replace
  the flat per-turn threshold.** The `coach-hook` Stop hook now sums each turn's
  **full** API-equivalent cost (input + output + cache-write + cache-read) into a
  running **per-session total** and fires graduated, **latched** alerts as that
  total crosses fractions of a per-session budget — once at **50% / 75% / 100%**,
  then every additional budget over (**200% / 300% / …**). This catches the
  expensive real-world shape the per-turn threshold missed: long, *flat* sessions
  (observed at 7,000–9,300 turns and ~$2,400 API-equivalent) where no single turn
  is extreme but the accumulation compounds. Because the metric is dollars, it is
  **model-agnostic**. The `--threshold`/`--cooldown` flags are replaced by
  `--budget` (default `$50`) on both `coach-hook` and `hooks install`. Still
  **non-blocking** and **fail-open**. `tokenops coach-hook stats` now reports
  spend and alerts-by-tier.

### Added

- **Usage-coaching hooks (Phase 1 of ADR 0001): Stop-hook nudge +
  `tokenops hooks install`.** A new `coach-hook` Claude Code **Stop** hook reads
  the tail of the session transcript after each turn and surfaces a
  **non-blocking** `systemMessage` nudge to compact or start a fresh session when
  a session carries too much reclaimable cache-read context (alerting model
  refined in Phase 1.1, above). It works for clients that never hit the tokenops
  proxy (e.g. Claude Code on a subscription) and **fails open** on every error
  path, so it can never disrupt a session. Cost is priced via the existing
  `spend` catalog.
- **`tokenops hooks install / uninstall / status`** — a scaffolder that
  idempotently merges the tokenops hooks (`--coach`, `--read-guard`) into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` without clobbering unrelated hooks, backs the prior
  file up to `settings.json.bak`, writes atomically, and reports the binary path
  + version being wired in. `--dry-run` previews without writing.

## 0.35.0 - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Over-time charts in `tokenops fmt analyze --svg`.** Alongside the existing
  bar charts, the analyzer now buckets your Claude Code logs by ISO week and
  renders three time-series SVGs: input vs output tokens per week (a shared
  linear axis, so output correctly reads as a persistent hairline), total
  tokens per week, and context composition (Read/Bash/prose) per week. Built on
  two new dependency-free chart primitives (`Lines`, `StackedArea`); emitted
  only when at least two weeks of timestamped data exist.
- **`--charts` flag** to select which SVGs `--svg` writes: `all` (default), a
  group (`bars` | `timeline`), or a comma-separated list of specific chart ids.
  An unknown name errors with the valid list.

### Fixed

- Over-time chart x-axis labels showed the raw week key (`2026-06-01`) instead
  of a compact `Jun 01`, from a stale date layout left after the weekly-bucket
  refactor.

## 0.34.0 - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Predictions now read the vendor's own rate-limit meter.** `session_budget`
  and `plan_headroom` previously computed window % from a message count that
  excluded the high-signal sources — so they could report `continue` at
  high confidence while the vendor's own meter read 87%. They now read the
  authoritative snapshot the pollers already store (Anthropic cookie
  five_hour/seven_day %, Codex rate_limits primary/secondary %, Copilot/Cursor
  monthly quota) with its exact reset time, falling back to the heuristic only
  when no snapshot exists. Also scores plans that publish a window but no
  message cap (Claude Code Max/Pro), and gives Copilot/Cursor a real monthly
  overage risk where they previously got "no cap published".
- **Exact tiktoken tokenizer for OpenAI** (o200k_base — GPT-4o / o-series /
  GPT-4.1 / GPT-5). Offline, embedded vocabulary (no runtime download). Replaces
  the char-per-token heuristic — whose ~10-15% error is worst on code and JSON —
  so every downstream $ / savings / headroom figure is exact for the
  highest-volume provider. Other providers stay heuristic.
- **4 more proxy providers (13 → 17):** local runtimes and self-hosted gateways
  — Ollama, LM Studio, LiteLLM, Vercel AI Gateway — each a one-line
  OpenAI-compatible add with its documented default endpoint as the preset.

### Changed

- **`read-guard` ledger is scoped per agent-context, not per session.** A
  subagent reading a file no longer blocks the main agent's later read of it
  (each agent has its own context window). Uses Claude Code's `agent_id`;
  strictly more permissive.
- **Optimizer savings estimates now tokenize the real before/after content**
  instead of a placeholder "canary" string (which returned ~bytes/4 and
  undercounted dense payloads). `retrieval_prune` is scored below the quality
  gate (it's a positional guess with no relevance signal); the dedupe docs no
  longer claim a semantic-embedding seam it doesn't have.

## 0.33.0 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **9 new proxy-metered providers (4 → 13).** The OpenAI-compatible fleet —
  Groq, DeepSeek, xAI, Perplexity, Fireworks, Cerebras, Together, OpenRouter —
  plus **Cohere** (its own v2 `/v2/chat` + v1 `/v1/chat` normalizer). Each meters
  with its own provider id, has a registered tokenizer, and ships list-price
  rate cards where a static card is accurate. Add any OpenAI-wire-format provider
  in one line via `NewOpenAICompatible`.
- **`tokenops provider set <name>`** now validates the name against known
  providers (an unknown name used to hard-crash the daemon at boot) and accepts
  an omitted URL to bind the built-in preset (`tokenops provider set groq`).
  `provider list` shows all presets for discovery.
- **Passive token attribution for opencode.** The first SQLite-backed vendor
  reader — opens `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` read-only, attributes
  every assistant turn per project/session, multi-provider. Enable with
  `tokenops vendor-usage enable opencode`.
- **Integration coverage docs** — the three-plane model (passive/MCP/proxy), the
  full provider list, and the honest boundaries (Gemini CLI has no local token
  log; Bedrock needs SigV4; hosted agents are out of reach).

## 0.32.0 - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **Module path moved to `go.klarlabs.de/tokenops`** (vanity import) and the repository to `github.com/klarlabs-studio/tokenops`. GitHub redirects keep old URLs and `go get` working. Homebrew tap unchanged (`brew install felixgeelhaar/tap/tokenops`).

## 0.31.1 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`tokenops spend --svg`** emits an input-vs-output ratio chart, and **`fmt analyze --svg`** now also emits `fmt-roi.svg` (formatter savings on your real command output). Four reproducible charts for docs/blogs.

## 0.31.0 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`tokenops fmt analyze --svg <dir>`** renders the analysis as
  self-contained SVG charts (composition + reads). Text uses `currentColor`
  so an inlined chart themes with its page; output is deterministic and
  reproducible from the CLI.

## 0.30.1 - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **`read-guard stats` now explains the re-read breakdown.** Instead of a
  bare "0 reclaimable", it splits repeat reads into reclaimable (unchanged
  full re-read — real waste), post-edit (file changed since last read — not
  waste), and ranged (intentional partial re-read). Observe mode is now
  informative about *why* a re-read was or wasn't blockable, so the decision
  to switch to active mode is grounded.

## 0.30.0 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`tokenops read-guard` — reclaim the Read re-read waste, no proxy needed.**
  A Claude Code PreToolUse hook that prevents redundant file re-reads at the
  source, so it works for clients whose traffic never reaches the tokenops
  proxy (e.g. Claude Code on a subscription). A re-read is redundant when the
  same file is read in full more than once in a session and is unchanged
  since (cheap mtime+size fingerprint — the file is never opened); ranged
  reads (offset/limit) are always allowed.
  - **observe** mode (default): logs what it would block + reclaimable
    tokens from live sessions, zero interference.
  - **active** mode: denies the redundant re-read and tells the model to use
    the copy already in its context.
  - `tokenops read-guard hook` prints the settings.json block;
    `tokenops read-guard stats` shows reclaimable/reclaimed tokens.

- **Self-wiring fmt learning** — the fmt loop now derives its signal from the
  Claude Code logs (`~/.claude/projects`) that already exist, with no daemon,
  no wrapped commands, and no setup:
  - **`tokenops fmt analyze`**: reads your logs, reports context composition
    (Read vs Bash vs prose) and dry-runs every Bash command's output through
    the formatter engine to estimate what fmt would save on your real
    traffic. Nothing is persisted — only sizes.
  - **`tokenops fmt learn`** now folds in that log-derived signal by default
    (`--no-jsonl` to opt out), so it reflects real usage out of the box.
  - **MCP `tokenops_fmt_analyze`** (+ `tokenops_fmt_learn` folds in log
    signal) expose the same to agents.
  - **Read-side diagnostic**: `fmt analyze` now also measures the biggest
    context slice — Read (file content) — surfacing re-read waste (same file
    re-read in a session), byte-identical duplicate content, ranged-read
    hygiene, and the most-re-read files. Re-reads/dupes are a
    context-management issue (addressable by the proxy dedupe/context-trim
    optimizers), not a formatter one; the diagnostic makes the size visible.

### Fixed

- **Log discovery walked only one directory level** — the vendor-usage
  file-finder globbed `<root>/*/*.jsonl`, silently missing sessions nested
  deeper (worktrees, sub-checkouts). The fmt analyzer now walks recursively,
  seeing all sessions instead of a small fraction.
- **Compound-command attribution** — `cd /path && go test` attributed the
  command output to `cd` (no-output prefix) instead of `go`, hiding
  compressible output from the right formatter. The analyzer now splits the
  chain and skips `cd`/`export`/`source` prefixes.

### Added

- **`fmt` catalog fast-follow → 51 formatters / 57 command tokens.** New
  formatters: `nomad`, `packer`, `gem`, `swift`, `nix`, plus `oc`
  (OpenShift) routed to the `kubectl` formatter as an alias. Each ships
  golden critical-line survival + monotonic tests and is enrolled across
  every plane. `vault` intentionally deferred (its output carries secret
  values; compressing secrets is poor optics for little gain).
- **Proxy-plane regression test**: `command_fmt` is now covered by an
  end-to-end test that runs a realistic Anthropic `tool_result` through the
  default pipeline and asserts a `command_fmt` event with real savings.

## 0.28.1 - 2026-07-03

### Documentation

- Document the `tokenops fmt` command-output compression subsystem across
  the docs site and README: CLI reference (`fmt` / `bench` / `hook` /
  `recover` / `learn`), the `optimizer.command_fmt` configuration section
  (loss levels, user-defined formatters, learn loop), the new formatter and
  fmtlearn packages in the architecture doc, and the MCP tool count (26).

## 0.28.0 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **User-extensible `fmt` catalog + local self-tuning** — the learning loop
  now closes on the user's own machine, no maintainer or recompile needed:
  - **Config-defined formatters** (`optimizer.command_fmt.formatters`): add
    or override a formatter for any command by declaring `critical` regexes
    (always preserved) and per-level `drop` regexes — no rebuild. User rules
    run through the same `enforceCritical` guard as built-ins, so a mistaken
    drop rule can never remove a critical line.
  - **`tokenops fmt learn --apply`**: writes the safe part of the learning
    report (per-command loss-level `overrides`) into the user's config
    locally. Level tuning never touches critical rules, so it is safe to
    auto-apply. New-formatter candidates are printed as a paste-ready config
    stub, never auto-written.
  - **MCP `tokenops_fmt_learn`**: exposes the advisory learning report to
    agents so they can drive catalog improvements programmatically.
  - Shared `fmtindex` adapter backs the CLI and MCP so both read one index.

## 0.27.0 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`tokenops fmt` catalog expanded to 46 commands / 51 tokens.** 29 new
  deterministic formatters across every category an agent shells out to:
  - RTK parity: `gh`, `jest`, `vitest`, `golangci-lint`, `ruff`, `rubocop`,
    `prettier`, `biome`, `rspec`, `playwright`, `uv`, `bundle`, `pulumi`.
  - Differentiators RTK does not support: `bazel`, `ansible`
    (+`ansible-playbook`), `helm`, `dotnet`, `aws`, `gcloud`, `az`
    (multi-cloud — RTK is AWS-only), `sbt`, `mix`, `composer`,
    `dnf` (+`yum`), `brew`, `flyway`, `alembic`, `cmake`, `ninja` — the
    noisiest build / config-mgmt / cloud / migration tooling RTK ignores.
  Cloud CLIs (`aws`/`gcloud`/`az`) pass JSON through untouched (the generic
  dedup is unsafe on structured output) and only compress table/text.
  Every formatter ships golden critical-line survival + monotonic-reduction
  tests and is enrolled across every plane (CLI, hook, proxy, bench).
  Benchmark over the checked-in corpus (47 KB, 46 commands): balanced 57%,
  aggressive 68% aggregate; standouts helm 84/92%, go test 86/92%, npm 84%,
  pip 82%, uv 78%, mvn 76%, bazel 72%.

## 0.26.0 - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Deterministic command-output compression** (`tokenops fmt`): wraps a
  command, compresses its stdout with a per-command formatter before the
  output enters the agent context, and preserves the full output in
  `~/.tokenops/recovery/`. Two invariants hold at every loss level:
  determinism (pure `(raw, level)` function) and critical-line survival
  (errors / failures / changed state are never dropped — a formatter that
  would drop one falls back to raw passthrough). Loss is configured per
  command (`optimizer.command_fmt.default` + `overrides`:
  conservative | balanced | aggressive).
  - Formatter catalog (17): `git status`, `go test`, `npm`, `cargo`,
    `pytest`, `docker build`, `kubectl`, `terraform`, `pip` (+`pip3`),
    `tsc`, `eslint`, `yarn` (+`pnpm`), `make`, `mvn`, `gradle`,
    `apt` (+`apt-get`), `curl -v`, plus an always-safe generic noise
    scrub. Formatters can register command aliases.
  - `tokenops fmt bench --corpus <dir>` measures savings over captured
    command outputs; `tokenops fmt hook` emits env-gated shell wrappers
    (RTK-style auto-rewrite, opt-in via `TOKENOPS_FMT=1`).
  - `--emit` (or `command_fmt.emit_events`) records an OptimizationEvent
    (kind `command_fmt`) so the dashboard and scorecard count the savings.
  - Proxy plane: a `command_fmt` optimizer compresses tool-output blocks
    (Anthropic `tool_result`, OpenAI `role:tool`) in the request body via
    content-sniffing, so agents without the shell hook still benefit.
  - **Offline learning loop** (`tokenops fmt learn`): mines the recovery
    index (compression + re-access records) to propose where the catalog
    should improve — next formatters to write (commands falling back to
    the generic scrub, ranked by raw bytes) and possible over-compression
    (commands whose compact output is re-fetched often via
    `tokenops fmt recover <id>`, with loss-level tuning hints). Advisory
    only: the formatters stay deterministic; proposals become
    corpus-gated code changes, never runtime self-modification.

## 0.25.1 - 2026-06-12

### Security

- `tokenops config show` (and the MCP/dashboard config surfaces) no
  longer print secrets: the CLI bypassed the redaction snapshot
  entirely, and redaction only covered OTel headers. All secret fields
  (dashboard admin token, Anthropic admin key, claude.ai session key,
  Cursor cookie, Copilot OAuth token) are now masked through a single
  Config.Redacted() path.

## 0.25.0 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Mistral proxy support**: `/mistral/` route to api.mistral.ai with
  request normalization for chat-completions and FIM (codestral), plus
  a heuristic tokenizer — Mistral traffic is now observable and
  costable through the proxy like OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini.
- **Gemini plan**: `gemini-ai-premium` (Google One AI Premium) catalog
  entry; windowless (Google publishes no caps).

### Fixed

- Copilot, Cursor, and Anthropic admin-API poller events are marked as
  quota/aggregate snapshots and no longer count as user messages in
  plan window math.

## 0.24.0 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **API-equivalent spend metric**: `tokenops spend` shows
  `api equivalent` and `tokenops_spend_summary` returns
  `api_equivalent_usd` — what the window would have billed at API list
  prices, including plan-covered traffic. On flat plans this is the
  shadow value the subscription absorbed.
- **Budget basis** (`budgets[].basis: spend | equivalent`): flat-plan
  deployments can watch list-price value instead of real spend (which
  is ~$0 forever on a subscription). `tokenops_budget_set` accepts
  `basis`. Equivalent budgets get threshold alerts (no forecast).
- **Central plan stamping**: events are stamped `plan_included` at the
  storage sink for any provider with a plan bound — covers every
  poller (cursor, copilot, anthropic-cookie, admin API), the proxy
  observer, and future emitters without per-emitter wiring.

### Fixed

- CI/release workflows forced to Node 24 ahead of GitHub removing
  Node 20 from runners (2026-09-16).

## 0.23.1 - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Vendor-usage pollers (claude-code JSONL, codex JSONL, legacy stats
  cache) stamp events `plan_included` when a flat-rate plan is bound to
  their provider — subscription-covered usage is no longer repriced at
  API list rates by spend summaries, and budget alerts stop firing on
  spend that never billed. Only newly ingested events are stamped.
- Plan window math no longer counts assistant-turn events against the
  vendor's messages meter (one prompt fans out into many tool-use
  turns; the meter was reading ~10-50x over). Their tokens still count.
- Spend forecasts clamp at zero instead of predicting negative spend
  on declining trends.

## 0.23.0 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **`tokenops_mode` ensures a daemon**: setting `active` via MCP probes
  the daemon's advertised URL and, when nothing answers, starts
  `tokenops start` detached with the freshly written config (logs to
  `daemon.log` next to `events.db`). A running daemon is left alone
  with a restart reminder. Active mode can no longer be a silent no-op.

### Fixed

- Plan-included and trial events are excluded from cost recompute and
  unpriced-model detection: recompute could invent list-price spend
  for flat-rate traffic (aggregation drops the cost source), and the
  `mcp-session` pseudo-model tripped the unpriced-model warning on the
  watcher's first tick.

## 0.22.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Claude Fable 5 pricing** (`claude-fable-5*`, $10/$50 per MTok) plus
  `claude-opus-4-8` / `claude-opus-4-6` rows in the price catalog.
- **Data-driven pricing catalog**: rates moved from Go constants to an
  embedded `pricing.yaml`; `pricing.path` (or `TOKENOPS_PRICING_PATH`)
  layers operator overrides — price newly released models or negotiated
  rates without upgrading.
- **Unpriced-model warnings**: `tokenops spend` and the
  `tokenops_spend_summary` MCP tool flag models the catalog cannot
  cost instead of silently under-reporting totals.
- **Model routing rules** (`optimizer.routing_rules`): replay reports
  per-rule "would save $X" rollups so a route can be validated on real
  history offline.
- **Operating modes** (`mode: passive | active`): active mode applies
  routing rules to live proxied traffic (recorded as applied
  optimization events; original requested model preserved in the
  observation) and runs a background spend watcher that evaluates
  `budgets` (calendar windows + Holt forecast) every `watch.interval`
  and flags unpriced models.
- **MCP config tools**: `tokenops_mode`, `tokenops_budget_set`,
  `tokenops_routing_rule_set` mutate the same config.yaml the CLI
  manages, validated before every write.
- **Configurable waste thresholds** (`coaching.context_limits`):
  per-workflow-prefix overrides for the waste detector; operator
  config now wins over the built-in claude-code/codex profiles.
- Prompt-coach savings priced at each turn's observed model instead of
  a flat claude-opus-4-7 assumption.

### Fixed

- `claude-opus-4-7` list price corrected from $15/$75 to $5/$25 per
  MTok (Opus 4.1-era rate had been carried over). Recomputed
  historical opus-4-7 costs drop ~3x; coaching savings projections
  shrink accordingly.
- Demo fixture rates now derive from the catalog (the seeded
  gemini-2.5-pro output rate had drifted).

## 0.21.1 - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Three F-grade scorecard artifacts that didn't reflect operator
  behaviour:
  - **TEU**: zero optimisation events now means "N/A" (default
    15% applied), not 0% F. The optimiser only runs on
    proxy-routed traffic; JSONL-only mode shouldn't trip an F.
  - **SAC**: `rowToEnvelope` now syncs `PromptEvent.SessionID`/
    `WorkflowID`/`AgentID` from the indexed columns when the
    payload JSON field is empty, so column-side backfills
    (e.g. `claude-code-jsonl` v0.14.3) propagate to the
    scorecard reader. `defaultExcludedSources` also excludes
    `vendor-usage-anthropic` and `claude-code-stats-cache`
    from the denominator — those sources don't carry per-session
    attribution by design.
  - **CGR**: `filterAutonomousLoopSentinels` drops `continue` /
    `proceed` / `keep going` prompts when they repeat >5x in the
    same session (`/loop` dynamic-mode pacing, not human acks).
- Overall grade improves from F → B on real 30-day data.

## 0.21.0 - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`tokenops task list --metrics`** enriches every task with
  the events-store rollup over its `[StartedAt, CompletedAt]`
  window:
  - Turns (count of prompt events)
  - InputTokens / OutputTokens
  - CostUSD (cache-aware)
  - TTFUOSeconds (time from task start to first assistant turn)
  - Duration (wall-clock span)
  - CostPerTurn
  JSON output ships `{"tasks": [...], "metrics": {id → Metrics}}`
  for MCP-host UIs. The task boundary primitive from v0.20.0
  now produces task-attributed metrics agents and operators
  can act on (cost-per-task, iteration depth, TTFUO).

## 0.20.0 - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Wired CHR/CGR/RGR data sources** so `tokenops scorecard`
  actually surfaces the v0.19.0 KPIs against the live store.
  CHR is computed in `scorecard.Compute` from PromptEvents
  (with legacy-attribute fallback for pre-v0.14.2 envelopes
  so dashboard + scorecard agree on the same %). CGR + RGR
  are computed in the CLI from JSONLs via `prompts.Extract` +
  `prompts.Analyze` (new regenerate detector matches "try
  again / redo / wrong / not what I wanted").
- **Two more scorecard KPIs** alongside the v0.19.0 trio:
  - **TCS — Tool Success Rate**: % of tool calls returning
    without `is_error`. Higher is better. Thresholds
    ≥95 / ≥85 / ≥70.
  - **DAR — Destructive Action Rate**: % of bash invocations
    matching the destructive allow-list (rm -rf, force-push,
    drop table, …). Lower is better. Thresholds
    ≤0.5 / ≤2 / ≤5%.
  - New `internal/contexts/coaching/tools/` package walks
    Claude Code JSONL `tool_use` + `tool_result` blocks and
    pairs them by `ToolUseID`.
- **`tokenops task start|done|list`** — operator-marked task
  boundaries written to `$HOME/.tokenops/tasks.jsonl`.
  Unblocks task-level metrics (cost-per-task, iteration
  depth, TTFUO) by giving the operator a way to declare a
  unit of work. The `task` command tree is the foundation;
  scorecard wiring for task-attributed metrics follows.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Tangible turn-savings on the coach** (`tokenops coach prompts`):
  new `prompts.TurnStats` and `prompts.ComputeTurnStats` walk the
  same JSONL tree the extractor uses, sum assistant-turn input/
  output/cache tokens, and price them at cache-aware rates. The
  CLI renderer projects each `Recommendation`'s monthly turn
  savings into tokens / dollars / hours of attention. Header line
  shows the operator's per-turn rollup so they can verify the
  assumption.
- **Three new scorecard KPIs** alongside FVT/TEU/SAC:
  - **CHR — Cache Hit Ratio**: % of input tokens that are cache
    reads. Higher is better. Thresholds ≥90 / ≥70 / ≥50.
  - **CGR — Confirmation Gate Rate**: % of user prompts that are
    pure acks. Lower is better. Thresholds ≤10 / ≤20 / ≤30.
  - **RGR — Regenerate Rate**: % of user prompts rejecting prior
    agent output. Lower is better. Thresholds ≤5 / ≤10 / ≤20.
  - New `AgentKPIInputs` struct + `NewWithAgentKPIs` constructor;
    legacy `New(...)` stays backward-compat. `MarshalJSON` omits
    agent KPI blocks whose Grade is empty so consumers don't see
    a phantom F for a metric that was never computed.

### Changed

- `Findings.Recommendations` (v0.18) gains tangible savings via
  the renderer; the structured Recommendation shape is unchanged.
- Scorecard JSON output gains optional `cache_hit_ratio`,
  `confirmation_gate_rate`, `regenerate_rate` fields. Agent KPI
  blocks render in `String()` only when their Grade is set.

## 0.18.0 - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `tokenops coach prompts` now emits ranked structured
  `Recommendation`s grounded in the operator's own data.
  Each rec includes: `id`, `title`, `why` (data-grounded
  explanation), `evidence` (2-3 sample prompts pulled from
  the operator's JSONLs), `frequency`, `impact_score`,
  `estimated_monthly_turns_saved`, and `before`/`after`
  rewrite templates. Five rules ship: `scope_vague_directives`
  ("fix all" / "do it" / "merge it"),
  `reduce_confirmation_loops` (acks > 15%),
  `stop_repeating` (prompt issued 3+ times),
  `cite_file_paths` (≥30% short prompts without a file
  reference, min 20 prompts), `front_load_context`
  (fallback when nothing else fires).
- CLI now leads with a `BIGGEST WIN` panel — the
  highest-impact recommendation with evidence quotes and a
  before/after example — followed by an `ALSO WORTH FIXING`
  numbered list. JSON output (`--json`, MCP tool result)
  ships the structured slice for agent hosts to render
  their own UI.

### Changed

- `Findings.Recommendations` schema changed from `[]string`
  to `[]Recommendation`. The MCP tool result reflects the new
  shape — agent hosts parsing the JSON should expect the new
  fields.

## 0.17.1 - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Dashboard KPI tiles overflowed on real-data viewports because
  raw token counts (`6,039,345,464`) didn't fit the 140px tile
  font budget — values ellipsized mid-digit. Tokens / requests
  now render compact (`6.04B`, `14.1k`, `6.95M`); total cost
  drops cents on the tile. Full grouped values surface via the
  `title=` hover attribute. Chart Y-axes use the same compact
  formatter so cost reads `$1.0k / $800 / …` and tokens
  `600.00M / 400.00M` instead of clipped `0.0000 / 00,000`.
- Hero video on the docs site didn't autoplay on Chrome. The
  `<source>` fallback was a webm with `duration=N/A` (matroska
  doesn't write per-stream duration by default), which raced
  with the mp4 fetch and stalled playback. Dropped the webm
  source from the hero markup; mp4 is the only player spec
  advertised. New mp4 uses `yuv420p` + `color_range=tv` + Main
  level 4.0 + faststart for Safari/iOS autoplay too.

## 0.17.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **`tokenops coach replies`** — output-side sibling of `coach prompts`.
  Walks the same Claude Code / Codex JSONLs but extracts assistant
  replies and scores per session:
  - article density (`a/an/the` per word)
  - filler density (`just / really / basically / sure / ...`)
  - average word length
  - code-block ratio
  - **caveman-likely verdict** + rough estimated token savings
  Use to detect when an output-compression skill (e.g. caveman) is
  engaged and how many tokens it suppressed.

### Changed

- **Anthropic admin-API poller** now stamps `agent_id = "anthropic-admin"`
  and a synthetic `workflow_id = "anthropic-admin[:k=<api_key>][:w=<workspace>]"`
  on emitted prompt events. Previously these vendor-rolled rows had
  no attribution at all, which dragged scorecard SAC down to ~1%.
  Distinct API keys / workspaces still get distinct workflow buckets
  so the analyzer can group them.

## 0.16.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Per-project breakdown** for Claude Code JSONL: poller stamps
  `agent_id = "claude-code:<project>"` and
  `workflow_id = "claude-code:<project>:<session>"` on each event,
  derived from the JSONL parent directory name. Enables
  `group=agent` rollups to answer "which project burns the most".
- **Cache hit-rate API + dashboard tile**: `GET /api/spend/cache_stats`
  returns `total_input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`,
  `uncached_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_ratio`. New
  "Cache hit: XX.X%" tile alongside the existing KPI tiles.
  COALESCEs payload + legacy attributes so old events surface the
  split without a re-ingest.
- **Waste-detector profiles**: `ProfileFor("claude-code:...")` →
  900k peak / 2M growth; `ProfileFor("codex:...")` → 250k peak /
  500k growth. Stops every Code/Codex session tripping the
  short-workflow defaults (32k/16k). Operator-supplied Config
  values still win.
- **Codex parity** for the v0.14.x JSONL improvements:
  `codexjsonl` poller now sets `SessionID`, `AgentID="codex"`,
  `WorkflowID="codex:<session>"`, and `CachedInputTokens` on
  every PromptEvent. The cached split was being dropped, so
  Codex Plus/Pro users had the same ~10x cost over-estimate
  Claude Code users had before v0.14.2.
- **Prompt-coach cross-provider**: `tokenops coach prompts` auto-
  discovers both `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.codex/sessions`.
  Parses each dialect (flat `role=user` for Codex vs nested
  `type=user`+`message.content` for Claude Code). Filename
  timestamp fallback when Codex records omit their own.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `tokenops coach prompts` subcommand + `tokenops_coach_prompts`
  MCP tool. Heuristic prompt-quality feedback for Claude Code
  users: walks `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, extracts
  human-typed turns, and reports length distribution
  (under-5-word, 5-15, 15-50, 50-200, >200), vague-short
  count (<15 chars / ≤3 words), pure acknowledgements
  (yes/no/ok/continue), short questions, single-sentence
  no-context, and repeated prompts (verbatim 3+ times) — with
  concrete recommendations tuned to the operator's pattern.
  Privacy: prompt text is read at scan time and is never
  persisted to the event store.

## 0.14.3 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Claude Code JSONL events now carry `session_id` and a
  synthesized `workflow_id = "claude-code:<session>"` on the
  indexed columns (not just in attributes). `tokenops replay`,
  the workflow reconstructor, and the waste detector can now
  resolve a Claude Code session by ID — coach surface was dark
  for JSONL data because session_id only landed in the
  attributes map. Existing events can be backfilled with one
  UPDATE statement (see migration note below).

### Migration

Operators with pre-existing JSONL events should backfill via:

```sql
UPDATE events
SET session_id  = json_extract(attributes, '$.session_id'),
    workflow_id = 'claude-code:' || json_extract(attributes, '$.session_id')
WHERE source = 'claude-code-jsonl' AND session_id IS NULL;
```

After the backfill, `tokenops replay --workflow 'claude-code:<session>'`
surfaces coach findings (oversized context, runaway growth).

## 0.14.2 - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Dashboard cost over-estimated by ~9x against real Claude Code
  data because cache reads were billed at the new-input rate
  ($15/M for claude-opus-4-7) instead of the cache rate
  ($1.50/M). For agent workflows that reuse context heavily,
  >99% of input tokens are cache reads — order-of-magnitude
  difference. claudecodejsonl poller now writes the cache_read
  split into `PromptEvent.CachedInputTokens`; aggregator
  recompute reads it back from the payload JSON, with a fallback
  to `attributes.cache_read_input` so existing events re-cost
  correctly without a re-ingest. Verified end-to-end on a
  6.27B-input-token / 7.55M-output 7-day window: $94,253 →
  $10,457.

## 0.14.1 - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Dashboard `TOTAL COST` tile rendered as `$0.00` whenever data
  came from vendor-usage-jsonl sources (Claude Code JSONL, Codex
  JSONL). Those readers ship token counts but no prices, so
  `cost_usd` lands as NULL in the events table. `AggregateBy`
  already recomputed via `spend.Engine` (the per-bucket chart was
  correct); `Summarize` bypassed that path. Fix: after the SUM,
  group unpriced events by `(provider, model)`, sum tokens, call
  `spend.Engine.Compute` once per group. Linear pricing → one
  call per group matches the per-event sum exactly. SQL filter
  uses `cost_usd IS NULL OR cost_usd = 0` because the serializer
  stores 0 floats as NULL under STRICT mode.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `tokenops vendor-usage enable <source>` subcommand. Writes a
  vendor-usage source's config block to the active config file so
  operators don't hand-edit YAML to flip the v0.13.0 pollers on.
  Sources: `anthropic-cookie`, `cursor`, `github-copilot`,
  `codex-jsonl`, `claude-code-jsonl`, `anthropic-admin`. Secrets
  accept env-var fallback (`TOKENOPS_ANTHROPIC_COOKIE_SESSION_KEY`,
  `TOKENOPS_CURSOR_COOKIE`, `TOKENOPS_COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
  `TOKENOPS_ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY`) so they don't leak through shell
  history. `--disable` flips `Enabled=false` without clearing
  persisted secrets — toggling on/off is one flag, not a re-paste.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Codex CLI JSONL reader (`vendor_usage.codex_jsonl.enabled: true`).
  Parses `~/.codex/sessions/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/rollout-*.jsonl`,
  emits one PromptEvent per `event_msg` carrying OpenAI's
  authoritative `rate_limits` block (5h primary + weekly secondary
  used_percent + resets_at). 30s scan, dedup by (sessionID,
  sequence). `signal_quality` promotes to HIGH on any observation.
  Source tag `codex-jsonl`; envelope IDs `cdx-<sha8>`.
- GitHub Copilot quota poller (`vendor_usage.github_copilot.enabled:
  true`). Calls `api.github.com/copilot_internal/user` with the
  OAuth token discovered from `~/.config/github-copilot/apps.json`
  (or `hosts.json`) — same file the IDE plugins use. Returns live
  `quota_snapshots` (`chat`, `premium_interactions`) with
  `percent_remaining`, `entitlement`, `overage_count`, `unlimited`.
  Two-minute scan, dedup by `timestamp_utc`. Source tag
  `github-copilot`; envelope IDs `ghc-<sha8>`. `ProviderGitHub`
  added to eventschema.
- Cursor `/api/usage` poller (`vendor_usage.cursor.{enabled, cookie,
  user_id}`). Calls `cursor.com/api/usage?user=<id>` with the
  `WorkosCursorSessionToken` cookie the IDE uses; flat-map response
  yields one envelope per model row. Two-minute scan. Source tag
  `cursor-web`; envelope IDs `cur-<sha8>`. `ProviderCursor` added
  to eventschema.
- Anthropic cookie scraper (`vendor_usage.anthropic_cookie.{enabled,
  session_key}`). Polls `claude.ai/api/organizations` then
  `/api/organizations/{org_id}/usage` with the operator's browser
  `sessionKey` — same data Anthropic's own UI shows (5-hour, 7-day,
  7-day-opus utilization + extra_usage). Org ID auto-resolves on
  first scan; Chrome UA to bypass Cloudflare. Five-minute scan,
  dedup by `five_hour.reset_at`. **First and only source of the
  official Claude Max weekly utilization %.** Source tag
  `anthropic-cookie`; envelope IDs `ack-<sha8>`.
- `SignalSourceCodexJSONL`, `SignalSourceCopilot`,
  `SignalSourceCursor`, `SignalSourceAnthropicCookie` added to the
  `signal_quality` enum. `ClassifySignal` precedence:
  `VendorAPIWired > AnthropicCookie > ClaudeCodeJSONL >
  CodexJSONL > Copilot > Cursor > Proxy(high/medium) >
  ClaudeCodeCache(medium, deprecated) > MCPPings(low)`.
- `tokenops vendor-usage status` surfaces all four new source rows
  with config-hint copy that names the exact YAML key to set.

## 0.12.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Claude Code JSONL reader (`vendor_usage.claude_code_jsonl.enabled:
  true`). Parses `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` —
  Claude Code's live per-turn conversation record — and emits one
  PromptEvent per assistant turn with the full `message.usage`
  block (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`,
  `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `service_tier`). Tolerates 15MB+
  files (4MB scanner buffer), skips user/tool turns and zero-token
  rows. 30s scan, dedup by Anthropic message_id. `signal_quality`
  promotes to HIGH on any observation. Source tag
  `claude-code-jsonl`; envelope IDs `ccj-<sha8>`.
- `SignalSourceClaudeCodeJSONL` added to the signal enum;
  `claude-code-stats-cache` reader deprecated (still functional;
  emits at `medium` confidence with an upgrade-path hint).

### Changed

- The v0.10.2 `claude-code-stats-cache` reader is deprecated. On
  active Claude Code users `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` lags by
  days; the JSONL reader is the supported source going forward.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Per-model stacked area chart on the dashboard cost panel. Top-5
  legend with a "+N more" chip; colour scale is `d3.schemeTableau10`
  ordered by sorted model name so hues stay stable across refresh.
  Single-model filter falls back to the line view.
- `tokenops vendor-usage backfill --hours N` one-shot pull of
  historical Anthropic Admin API usage into the local store.
  Deterministic envelope IDs so re-running or running alongside the
  live poller never double-counts. `--dry-run` prints would-insert
  count without writing.
- `tokenops dashboard rotate-token` CLI command that mints a fresh
  32-byte URL-safe secret, atomic-writes to
  `~/.tokenops/dashboard.token`, and reminds the operator to restart
  the daemon. Fails when `config.dashboard.admin_token` is set
  explicitly (config value wins).
- Mistral Le Chat Pro + Codex Plus plan catalog entries.
  `eventschema.ProviderMistral` plus `mistral-large/medium/small +
  codestral` rows in the default spend pricing table.
- Dashboard filter selections persist in localStorage so window /
  provider / model picks survive page refresh. Quiet failure on
  storage exceptions (Safari private mode etc).
- Inline SVG favicon for the dashboard browser tab.

## 0.10.5 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Dashboard gains provider + model filter dropdowns. Options
  auto-populate from `group=provider` / `group=model` series queries
  so the list always reflects what the store actually contains in
  the current window.

## 0.10.4 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `tokenops vendor-usage status` CLI command. Reads config + counts
  source-tagged envelopes per source over a configurable window;
  prints a hint per source pointing at the missing config knob when
  a source is dark. Offline (no daemon HTTP call).

## 0.10.3 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Dashboard auth: `/dashboard` + `/api/*` require a shared-secret
  token (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/version` stay public). Three
  credential channels accepted in constant time: `Authorization:
  Bearer`, `?token=…` query param, session cookie. Browser-style
  query-param auth mints a session cookie and 303s to a clean URL.
- Token auto-managed: 32-byte random value persisted at
  `~/.tokenops/dashboard.token` on first start. Override via
  `cfg.Dashboard.AdminToken`.
- `tokenops_dashboard` MCP tool returns a URL with the token
  pre-attached so the operator gets a one-click authenticated visit.

## 0.10.2 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Vendor /usage ingestion lands. Two new signal sources:
  - **Claude Code stats cache reader.** Reads
    `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` on a tick, emits one `PromptEvent`
    per (date, model) delta with `Source="claude-code-stats-cache"`.
    Promotes `signal_quality` to medium with an explicit caveat
    that the schema is undocumented and granularity is daily-only.
  - **Anthropic Admin API poller.** Calls
    `/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages` every 5min, emits one
    `PromptEvent` per (bucket, model) cell with
    `Source="vendor-usage-anthropic"`. Promotes `signal_quality` to
    high. Requires `sk-ant-admin-*` key.
- `config.vendor_usage.{claude_code,anthropic}` blocks wire the
  pollers. Both are off by default.

### Notes

- Per Anthropic's documented API surface, the Admin API covers
  metered API usage only. Claude Max plan window state has no
  documented endpoint and remains heuristic.

## 0.10.1 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Daemon advertises itself as `tokenops.local` over zeroconf on
  Start. Dashboard URL becomes `http://tokenops.local:7878/dashboard`
  instead of a bare loopback address. The MCP `tokenops_dashboard`
  tool prefers the mDNS URL; falls back to `127.0.0.1` when `.local`
  resolution isn't available.
- URL hint file (`~/.tokenops/daemon.url`) gains a `local_url`
  field. Advertised IPs match the bind address: loopback-only
  listener publishes `127.0.0.1` so the `.local` hostname resolves
  on-host; wildcard / LAN listener publishes every non-loopback
  interface.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Interactive Vue + D3 dashboard** served by the daemon at
  `/dashboard`. Cost-over-time line, tokens-per-bucket stacked bar,
  KPI tiles, 15s auto-refresh.
- **Inline SVG charts in MCP responses.** `tokenops_session_budget`
  leads with a coloured headroom gauge (green / amber / red);
  `tokenops_burn_rate` ships a sparkline. Rendered inline in
  markdown so every MCP client shows them today.
- **Auto-detect on init.** `tokenops init --detect` sniffs Claude
  Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, ChatGPT Desktop, and standard
  API-key env vars, then prints the exact `tokenops plan set …`
  commands for what it found.
- **Dynamic-cheapest coaching router.** Coaching pipeline picks the
  lowest blended-rate model per provider from the pricing table at
  runtime. No hardcoded model names.
- **`tokenops_dashboard` MCP tool** returns a clickable URL to the
  local dashboard, or a structured `{error, hint}` payload when the
  daemon is not running.

## 0.9.4 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `tokenops spend --include-demo` mirrors the MCP tool flag so CLI
  users can opt back into seeded data without editing the filter
  struct. Default (no flag) keeps demo events excluded.

### Fixed

- `tokenops status` falls back to the same self-report the MCP
  tokenops_status tool emits when the daemon is unreachable.
  Operators see `blockers[]`, `next_actions[]`, version, and a
  `run tokenops start` hint instead of a raw connection-refused
  error. MCP-only deployments no longer hit a confusing CLI dead
  end.

## 0.9.3 - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Warming-up scorecard JSON drops the empty KPI blocks. Response now
  contains only `generated_at`, `overall_grade: warming_up`, optional
  `baseline_ref`, and `checklist`. Dashboards/agents see exactly what
  they need to render the empty state.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Scorecard now excludes `source=mcp-session` events from FVT/TEU/SAC
  compute, matching the demo-data isolation done in 0.8.1. Installs
  whose only real data is MCP-ping activity now see the warming_up
  checklist instead of a misleading `F` grade.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `tokenops demo --reset-only`: purges `source=demo` events without
  reseeding. Closes the gap that forced operators into raw SQL when
  they wanted to clean leftover seeded data. Idempotent.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **`signal_quality` on every session_budget and plan_headroom**:
  closed-set `level` (low|medium|high), `source`
  (mcp_tool_pings|proxy_traffic|vendor_usage_api), one-sentence
  `caveat`, and `upgrade_paths` so callers see exactly how trustworthy
  the underlying number is. Default response leads with
  `level: low, source: mcp_tool_pings` and a disclaimer.
- **Empty-state scorecard**: when no KPI has real-data backing, the
  scorecard returns `OverallGrade: warming_up` plus a 3-step
  activation checklist instead of a misleading `F`. CLI text
  renderer special-cases the warming-up state.
- **Data-warning banner on cost/headroom responses**: when synthetic
  events make up more than 10% of the queried window,
  `tokenops_spend_summary` / `tokenops_plan_headroom` /
  `tokenops_session_budget` attach a `data_warning` object with the
  ratio, real/demo counts, and the exact reset command.
- **Hot-reload on `tokenops plan set`**: `tokenops serve` polls the
  resolved config path every 2 seconds and swaps the snapshot
  atomically on mtime change. `PlanDeps.ConfigGetter` plumbs the
  live snapshot to every plan tool — operators no longer need to
  reconnect their MCP host after `tokenops plan set`.
- **Catalog-alias migration shim**: `plans.ResolveAlias` maps
  retired catalog names to modern entries. `tokenops plan set
  claude-max` prints `renamed claude-max -> claude-max-20x` and
  writes the modern name. Stale docs / blog posts keep working.
- **Launch plan + tracker docs**:
  `docs/launch-plan.md` (Loom script, Show HN post, Discord posts,
  founder-DM template, success criteria) and
  `docs/launch-tracker.md` (10-row tracker, per-call notes,
  synthesis rubric, negative-signal log) so the maintainer can run
  the GTM cycle from a single doc.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Scorecard compute path now filters Source=demo envelopes before
  computing FVT/TEU/SAC. v0.8.0 added the isolation everywhere
  except this query path so `tokenops demo` data continued to
  inflate the wedge KPIs.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Demo data isolation**: synthetic events seeded by `tokenops demo`
  are now excluded from every default analytics surface (`spend
  summary`, `top consumers`, `burn rate`, `forecast`, plan headroom +
  session budget). Opt back in with `include_demo: true` on the MCP
  tool input. `analytics.DefaultExcludedSources` is the single source
  of truth; pass `ExcludeSources: []string{}` to bypass.
- **`tokenops_data_sources` MCP tool**: groups events by source
  column (`proxy`, `mcp-session`, `demo`, `otlp`, …) so operators see
  at a glance whether headroom + spend math run on real or seeded
  data.
- **MCP session middleware**: every `tools/call` request increments
  `session.Tracker` regardless of which handler runs. Replaces the
  per-tool Record sites in `plan_headroom` / `session_budget` so the
  window-count signal is uniform across the surface.
- **`tokenops_help` MCP tool**: 6-category curated index (setup,
  session, cost, workflows, rules, debug) so agents and operators
  can navigate the 20+ tool surface without enumerating
  `tools/list`.

### Fixed

- **Rules walker**: `filepath.WalkDir` callback now tolerates
  `fs.ErrPermission` (skips the offending subtree / file) and
  `fs.ErrNotExist` (race between dir-listing and stat).
  `tokenops rules analyze --root ~/.claude` no longer aborts with
  `permission denied` from `~/Library/Saved Application State` and
  friends. Skip list extended to Library/Containers/.Trash.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- `tokenops plan list` (and other read-side subcommands routed via
  `loadConfig`) returned "no plans configured" right after `tokenops
  plan set` because the loader honoured only `--config` and env vars
  while the mutation verbs defaulted to the XDG path. `loadConfig`
  now auto-discovers `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tokenops/config.yaml` (or
  `~/.config/tokenops/config.yaml`) when `--config` is unset.
- Empty-state hint on `plan list` now points at `tokenops plan set …`
  instead of the legacy env-var instructions.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **MCP-first wedge**: TokenOps now observes operator activity inside
  the MCP session rather than relying on proxy traffic, which the
  three-skill review confirmed is the wrong consumption surface for
  flat-rate Claude Code / Cursor users.
  - `internal/contexts/spend/session` package: `Tracker.Record` emits
    a plan_included synthetic `PromptEvent` for every observed MCP
    tool invocation, so `ConsumptionInWindow` / `headroom` see real
    activity without a proxy.
  - `tokenops_session_budget` MCP tool: predicts whether the current
    session will hit the rate-limit cap; returns
    `recommended_action ∈ {continue, slow_down, switch_model,
    wait_for_reset}` with a confidence band.
  - `plans.ComputeSessionBudget` pure function with 7 unit tests
    covering the recommendation matrix.
- **Config-as-code primitive**:
  - `tokenops plan set <provider> <plan>` / `tokenops plan unset`
    replace the previous JSON-edit-the-MCP-host-config flow.
  - `tokenops provider set|unset|list` mirrors the same verb shape.
  - Shared `config_mutate.go` helpers (`readMutableConfig`,
    `writeMutableConfig`) reusable for future `tokenops <subsystem>
    set` commands.
- **Hint sweep**: every structured `{error, hint}` payload now
  contains the exact corrective command (`tokenops plan set …`,
  `tokenops provider set …`) instead of an environment-variable name.
- **Customer discovery scaffolding**: `docs/customer-discovery.md`
  with a 9-question Torres-style interview script, recruitment
  targets, synthesis rubric, and reject criteria for the 5-user
  wedge validation sprint.

### Changed

- README quickstart replaces the env-var / JSON-edit instructions
  with `tokenops plan set anthropic claude-max-20x` (etc.).
- `docs/plan-cost-model.md` notes the proxy is no longer the primary
  observation surface; MCP-side activity is the new default.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Rate-limit window headroom** for subscription plans that publish
  rolling windows instead of monthly token caps.
  - `Plan` gains `MessagesPerWindow` + `WindowUnit` fields; catalog
    splits generic `claude-max` into `claude-max-5x` (50 msgs / 5h)
    and `claude-max-20x` (200 msgs / 5h). Adds documented caps for
    `claude-pro`, `gpt-plus`, `gpt-team`.
  - `HeadroomReport` gains `window_cap`, `window_consumed`,
    `window_pct`, `window_resets_in`, `window_unit` fields.
    `overage_risk` headline takes the worst of monthly and window
    signals.
  - `tokenops plan headroom` text output prints both monthly and
    window lines; `tokenops_plan_headroom` MCP tool exposes the same
    fields.
  - `internal/contexts/spend/plans.ConsumptionInWindow` reader counts
    plan-included PromptEvents over a trailing window.

### Changed

- Generic `claude-max` removed from the plan catalog. Users on the
  Anthropic Max plan should pick `claude-max-5x` or `claude-max-20x`
  depending on their tier.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Plan-Based Cost Model**: subscription-aware spend tracking for
  Claude Max / Pro, Claude Code Max / Pro, ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team,
  GitHub Copilot Individual / Business, Cursor Pro / Business.
  - `PromptEvent.CostSource` enum (`metered` default,
    `plan_included`, `trial`); schema bumped to 1.2.0.
  - `internal/contexts/spend/plans` package: catalog with dated
    `SourceURL` per plan, `ComputeHeadroom` returning
    `consumed_pct` / `headroom_days` / `overage_risk` (low / medium
    / high / unknown), and `ConsumptionFor` reader.
  - `tokenops plan list|headroom|catalog` CLI subcommands and
    `tokenops_plan_headroom` MCP tool.
  - `Config.Plans` map (`plans:` YAML block or
    `TOKENOPS_PLAN_<PROVIDER>` env) validated against the catalog.
  - `tokenops demo --plan <name>` stamps PromptEvents with
    `cost_source=plan_included` so the headroom surface populates on
    a fresh install.
  - `docs/plan-cost-model.md` documents the catalog and add-a-plan
    workflow.
- Spend engine short-circuits `Compute` to zero for `plan_included`
  and `trial` events so flat-rate traffic doesn't inflate metered
  `cost_usd`.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `tokenops demo` now seeds `OptimizationEvent`s alongside prompts
  (~40% rate, 20–40% savings) so the first-run scorecard reflects a
  realistic optimizer mix and TEU lifts off zero. Demo output reports
  prompts vs. optimizations separately.
- Scorecard `KPIResult` gained `name` + `description` fields so
  operators can decode the FVT / TEU / SAC abbreviations inline.
  `tokenops scorecard` text output adds a Definitions block.
- Roady backlog: new `Plan-Based Cost Model` feature spec covering
  Claude Max / ChatGPT Plus / Copilot / Cursor flat-rate plans
  (cost_source on PromptEvent, plan quota tracking, headroom metrics).
  Implementation deferred to its own cycle.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- `tokenops_status` returned `state: "not_ready"` when MCP serve mode
  was actually ready but the on-disk config still listed disabled
  subsystems. New `degraded` state distinguishes "ready with reduced
  surface area" from "broken".

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-12

First-run activation and security-suppression governance.

### Added

- **`tokenops init`** scaffolds an opinionated config (sqlite storage
  + rules subsystem enabled at `$PWD`) at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tokenops/
  config.yaml`. Idempotent; `--force` overwrites, `--print-only`
  emits YAML to stdout without touching disk.
- **`tokenops demo`** seeds deterministic synthetic events
  (5 providers/models, 4 workflows, 3 agents, jittered tokens + cost)
  so `tokenops spend`, `tokenops scorecard`, `tokenops forecast`, and
  the MCP analytics tools return populated data on a fresh install.
  Flags: `--days`, `--per-day`, `--reset`, `--dry-run`, `--seed`.
- **Status blockers / next-actions**: `tokenops_status` MCP tool and
  the daemon's `/readyz` endpoint now expose `blockers[]`
  (`storage_disabled`, `rules_disabled`, `providers_unconfigured`) and
  `next_actions[]` so first-run callers see exactly what to fix
  without grepping config. `config.Blockers()` + `NextActionsFor()`
  are the canonical helpers.
- **Disabled-subsystem error contract**: daemon analytics + rules
  routes (`/api/spend/*`, `/api/optimizations`, `/api/audit`,
  `/api/rules/*`) now return `503 {error, hint}` when their
  subsystem is off, instead of an opaque `404`.
- **Suppression governance gate** (`internal/secgov`): `go test`
  now enforces that every entry in `security/vex.json` carries
  `_governance.{classification, last_reviewed, reviewed_by}` and
  every `.nox.yaml` `scan.exclude` entry is preceded by the same
  metadata in comments. Review age capped at 120 days.

### Changed

- `security/vex.json` waivers gain `_governance` metadata on all
  eight existing statements; bumped doc version to 2.
- README `Getting started` is now a 3-command quickstart
  (`init` → `demo` → `start`) plus a first-run troubleshooting
  table indexed by blocker identifier.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-12

The Rule Intelligence wedge lands plus a full DDD refactor: rule
artifacts (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Cursor rules, MCP policies) become
first-class operational telemetry, repository layout reorganises around
bounded contexts, and the MCP / HTTP / CLI surfaces all share the same
domain services. Adopts felixgeelhaar/{bolt, fortify v1.5.0, mcp-go}.

### Added

- **Rule Intelligence** (issue #12): full subsystem treating
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Cursor rules, MCP policies, and repo
  conventions as first-class operational telemetry.
  - `RuleSourceEvent` + `RuleAnalysisEvent` payloads (schema 1.1.0).
  - Analyzer (per-section token cost + density), Compressor (Jaccard
    near-duplicate pruning + quality gate), Router (dynamic injection
    with token + latency budgets), ROIEngine, Benchmark, Conflicts
    detector (redundant / drift / anti-pattern).
  - CLI: `tokenops rules analyze|conflicts|compress|inject|bench`.
  - MCP: `tokenops_rules_*` tools.
  - HTTP: `/api/rules/*` endpoints with cache invalidated by
    `RuleCorpusReloaded` domain event.
  - Vue dashboard `/rules` view.
- **Domain event bus** (`internal/domainevents`): typed cross-context
  pub/sub with async mode, bounded queue, panic recovery,
  cancellable subscriptions, slow-handler detection, drop / panic /
  dispatch counters. JSONL persistence with size-based rotation,
  fsync on close, lenient replay.
- **Telemetry contracts** + golden tests pinning the on-wire JSON for
  every envelope payload (`pkg/eventschema/golden_test.go`).
- **DDD architecture** (`docs/architecture-ddd.md`): bounded contexts,
  ubiquitous language glossary, layering rules. Enforced via
  `internal/archlint` — `go list -deps` based test fails CI when a
  domain package imports an adapter or undocumented infrastructure.
- **Composition root** `internal/bootstrap`: single construction site
  for sqlite store, spend engine, analytics aggregator, tokenizer
  registry, redactor, domain bus, event counter.
- **Eval gate** (`internal/contexts/optimization/eval`): regression
  thresholds on success rate, per-optimizer quality drift, optimizer
  presence. CLI: `tokenops eval [--baseline --enforce --output]`.
- **Wedge KPI scorecard** wired to live event store (FVT/TEU/SAC).
- **Coverage debt** (`internal/contexts/governance/coverdebt`):
  risk-weighted coverage report from Go cover profile.
- **Audit subscriber** wires `BudgetExceeded` + `OptimizationApplied`
  events to the audit log with bounded concurrency, drop counter.
- **`tokenops audit`** and **`tokenops events`** CLIs (with JSONL
  fallback when daemon unreachable, `--since` filter, URL-scheme
  aware).
- **`tokenops_domain_events`** MCP tool surfaces in-process event
  counts + audit drop counter.
- **fortify v1.5.0 adoption**: provider proxy routes can opt into
  `CircuitBreakerStream` via a new `resilience.*` config block. Each
  upstream gets its own circuit breaker plus FirstByte / Idle / Total
  watchdogs; stalled SSE streams surface as `504 Gateway Timeout`
  instead of hanging the client, and a flaky vendor trips without
  taking siblings offline. Off by default (no behaviour change for
  existing deployments). OTLP exporter wraps the upstream call in a
  fortify circuit breaker for finite-response fault tolerance.
- **bolt logger adoption**: `observ.NewLogger` now produces zero-alloc
  JSON via `github.com/felixgeelhaar/bolt` when `log.format=json`;
  text format retains stdlib slog.
- **mcp-go adoption**: `internal/mcp` is now a thin adapter over
  `github.com/felixgeelhaar/mcp-go`. JSON-RPC framing, schema
  generation, and stdio transport move upstream; every tool gets a
  typed input struct with auto-generated JSON schema. CLI `tokenops
  serve` calls `mcp.ServeStdio` instead of the prior handwritten loop.

### Changed

- Schema version 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 (additive: rule_source + rule_analysis
  event kinds, tokenops.rule.* OTLP attributes).
- Repository layout: domain packages moved under
  `internal/contexts/<ctx>/<pkg>`; `internal/infra/rulesfs/` carries
  filesystem-touching rule corpus loader.
- Config snapshot (`config.Config.Snapshot`) redacts OTel headers.
- Bus.Subscribe returns `*Subscription` with `Cancel()`.

### Fixed

- Bus close/publish race (queueClosed guard).
- Audit subscriber goroutine leak past shutdown.
- JSONLog rotation size tracked via `Stat`, no longer estimated.
- Daemon shutdown bounded by `cfg.Shutdown.Timeout` for both telemetry
  and domain bus drains.
- `LoadCorpus` deduplicates `RuleCorpusReloaded` events when the
  corpus digest hasn't changed.
