# MCP server

`tokenops serve` starts a Model Context Protocol server that exposes
TokenOps queries as tools. Register it in any MCP client (Claude
Desktop, Cursor, opencode, your own agent) to let an LLM ask "how much
did we spend last week?" or "show me the top wasteful workflows" —
answered from the local event store.

## Tools

| Tool                       | Purpose                                                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenops_spend_summary`   | Total requests / tokens / cost over a time window                      |
| `tokenops_top_consumers`   | Top N spenders grouped by model / provider / workflow / agent          |
| `tokenops_burn_rate`       | Spend over the last N hours (default 24)                               |
| `tokenops_forecast`        | Holt-forecasted daily spend for the next horizon_days                  |
| `tokenops_workflow_trace`  | Reconstructed workflow trace + waste-detector findings                 |
| `tokenops_agent_dx`        | What the operator's agent sessions are like to work with, graded       |
| `tokenops_story`           | An account of recent work, task by task — what was asked, what it took, where it went sideways |
| `tokenops_routing_advise`  | Which model a turn should run on, decided per turn from measured signal. Recommends; never applies |

`tokenops serve` registers considerably more than this — `tokenops_help`
lists every tool the running server exposes, which is the answer that
cannot go stale.

## Claude Desktop setup

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tokenops": {
      "command": "tokenops",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "TOKENOPS_STORAGE_PATH": "/Users/<you>/.tokenops/events.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The TokenOps tools surface in the tools list.

## Cursor / other clients

Any client speaking MCP over stdio works. Run `tokenops serve` as the
command; pass `TOKENOPS_STORAGE_PATH` to point at the events DB.

## Logs

Diagnostic output goes to stderr (stdout is reserved for the JSON-RPC
channel). Tail it via `tokenops serve 2>/tmp/tokenops-serve.log`.
