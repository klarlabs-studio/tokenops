# Configuration

The daemon reads `config.yaml` (path via `--config`) merged with
`TOKENOPS_*` environment variables; CLI flags win last.

## Operating modes

`mode` decides how TokenOps helps you optimize:

| Mode | What runs |
|---|---|
| `passive` (default) | Collect + analyze on demand. Proxy observes traffic and stamps costs; pollers ingest vendor usage; `spend` / `replay` / `coach` answer when asked. Nothing is altered, nothing fires on its own. |
| `active` | Everything in passive, plus interventions: the proxy **applies `optimizer.routing_rules` to live traffic** (requests for `from_model` are rewritten to `to_model` before reaching the upstream, recorded as applied optimization events), and the daemon runs a **background spend watcher** that evaluates `budgets` every `watch.interval` and warns about budget threshold/forecast breaches and unpriced models. |

Recommended path: run passive, use `tokenops replay` to validate what a
routing rule would have saved on real history, then flip `mode: active`
to enforce it.

Mode, budgets, and routing rules are also editable through the MCP
server — `tokenops_mode`, `tokenops_budget_set`, and
`tokenops_routing_rule_set` write the same `config.yaml` the CLI verbs
manage (validated before every write). The daemon picks the changes up
on its next restart.

Setting `mode: active` via `tokenops_mode` also **ensures a daemon is
running** — active mode's interventions (live routing, spend watcher)
live in the daemon, so activating without one would be a silent no-op.
If no daemon answers on its advertised URL, one is started detached
with the active config (logs land next to `events.db` in
`daemon.log`); if one is already running, the response reminds you to
restart it so it picks up the new mode.

## Model routing rules

`optimizer.routing_rules` feeds the model-routing optimizer used by
`tokenops replay` and the `tokenops_replay` MCP tool. Each rule says
"traffic asking for `from_model` could run on `to_model`"; `quality` is
your confidence (0–1] that the cheaper model preserves task quality.
Replay then reports what each rule would have saved on real history:

```
Model routing opportunities:
  - route claude-fable-5 -> claude-opus-4-8: 124 requests, would save $9.43
```

Replay never resends traffic upstream — routing rules are evaluated
offline against the local event store, so you can validate a rule's
savings before changing any client configuration.

With `mode: active`, the same rules are **enforced on live proxied
traffic**: the proxy rewrites the request's model before forwarding,
logs the intervention, and records an applied optimization event
(visible in the dashboard and `tokenops replay`). The observation keeps
the originally requested model, so you can always audit what clients
asked for versus what was served. Routing never breaks a request — any
parse failure forwards the original body untouched.

## Command-output compression (`command_fmt`)

`optimizer.command_fmt` configures `tokenops fmt` — the deterministic
compressor that shrinks a shell command's stdout **before** it enters an
agent's context, keeping every line the formatter classifies as critical
(errors, failures, changed state) and dropping noise. 46 commands ship
built in (git, go/pytest/jest/vitest/rspec/playwright, npm/pip/uv/…,
mvn/gradle/bazel/dotnet/cmake/…, docker/kubectl/helm, terraform/pulumi/
ansible, aws/gcloud/az, and more).

- `default` — loss level for any command without an override:
  - `conservative` — strip only unambiguous noise (ANSI, blank runs,
    duplicate lines). Nothing semantic dropped.
  - `balanced` (recommended) — also drop command-specific noise
    (progress, banners, up-to-date chatter).
  - `aggressive` — additionally collapse repetitive state (e.g.
    "+142 unchanged files") into a summary.
- `overrides` — per-command loss level (a noisy command can be dialed
  up without loosening the global default).
- `emit_events` — append a `command_fmt` OptimizationEvent per compressed
  run so the dashboard and scorecard count the savings.

Two invariants hold at **every** level, for built-in and user formatters
alike: **determinism** (pure function of input + level) and
**critical-line survival** (a formatter that would drop a critical line
falls back to the raw output instead). The full output is always kept in
`~/.tokenops/recovery/` for retrieval.

### User-defined formatters

`command_fmt.formatters` extends or overrides the catalog for any command
**without recompiling**. Declare the regexes that mark critical lines
(always preserved) and the noise regexes to drop per loss level:

```yaml
optimizer:
  command_fmt:
    formatters:
      - command: mytool
        aliases: [mt]
        critical: ["(?i)error", "FAILED", "^\\s*modified:"]
        drop:
          balanced:   ["^DEBUG ", "^\\s*at "]   # dropped at balanced + aggressive
          aggressive: ["^INFO "]                 # dropped at aggressive only
```

User rules run through the same critical-line guard as built-ins, so an
overly broad drop rule can never remove a line you marked critical — it is
preserved and the formatter falls back safely.

`tokenops fmt learn` mines usage telemetry to suggest which commands need a
formatter and which are over-compressing; `tokenops fmt learn --apply`
writes the safe loss-level tuning back to this config locally. The
`tokenops_fmt_learn` MCP tool exposes the same report to agents. See the
[CLI reference](./cli.md#command-output-compression-fmt).

## Budgets and the spend watcher

`budgets` define calendar-window (UTC) spend limits. In `mode: active`
the daemon evaluates them every `watch.interval` against actual spend
plus a Holt forecast for the remainder of the window, logging
`threshold_reached` and `forecast_breach` alerts (deduplicated per
window) and publishing `budget.exceeded` domain events. The watcher
also flags models missing from the pricing table. In passive mode
budgets are inert — define them ahead of time and flip the mode when
you want enforcement-grade visibility.

On flat-rate plans (Claude Max, ChatGPT Plus) real spend is ~$0 — a
`basis: spend` budget guards nothing. Use `basis: equivalent` to watch
the **API-equivalent value** instead: what the window's usage would
have billed at list prices, including plan-covered traffic. The same
figure appears as `api equivalent` in `tokenops spend` and
`api_equivalent_usd` in the `tokenops_spend_summary` MCP tool.
Equivalent-basis budgets get threshold alerts only (no forecast).

Plan-covered traffic is identified centrally: every event written to
the store for a provider with a plan bound in `plans:` is stamped
`plan_included` at the storage sink, regardless of which poller or
proxy produced it.

## Waste-detector context limits

The workflow waste detector (`tokenops replay --workflow`, the
`tokenops_workflow_trace` MCP tool, and the dashboard workflow view)
ships built-in thresholds per workflow type: `claude-code:` sessions
flag context above 900k tokens, `codex:` above 250k, everything else
above 32k. `coaching.context_limits` overrides them per workflow-ID
prefix — a matching entry replaces the built-in profile, and fields you
omit keep the detector defaults:

```yaml
coaching:
  context_limits:
    - workflow_prefix: "claude-code:"
      max_context_tokens: 500000          # flag earlier than the 900k default
      context_growth_limit_tokens: 1000000
      max_consecutive_agent_loops: 4
      system_redundancy_min: 3
```

## Pricing overrides

TokenOps ships an embedded list-price catalog (USD per million tokens)
used to cost every request. When a vendor releases a model the catalog
doesn't know yet, `tokenops spend` and the `tokenops_spend_summary` MCP
tool flag it:

```
⚠ no pricing for 1 model(s) — total spend is underestimated:
    anthropic/claude-fable-5[1m] (213 requests)
```

Add a rate without waiting for a TokenOps release — or apply negotiated
rates — via `pricing.path`. The file layers on top of the built-in
catalog; fields you omit inherit from the matching built-in row:

```yaml
# ~/.tokenops/pricing.yaml
currency: USD
rates:
  anthropic:
    "claude-fable-5*":            # trailing * = prefix match, covers
      input_per_million: 10.00    #   suffixed variants like [1m]
      output_per_million: 50.00
      cached_input_per_million: 1.00
```
