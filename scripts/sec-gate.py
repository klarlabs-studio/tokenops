"""Critical-only nox gate.

Reads `findings.json` produced by `nox scan` plus `security/vex.json`
and exits non-zero when at least one critical finding is not waived.

Lower-severity findings stay informational so the build does not
flap on every typosquatting-detector tweak; critical = either a known
exploited CVE or a high-confidence supply-chain attack and must be
addressed (fix or waive) before the change lands.
